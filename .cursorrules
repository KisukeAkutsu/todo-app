# Cursor AI Configuration for Conventional Commits

When generating commit messages, always follow the Conventional Commits specification:

Format: <type>: <description>

Available types:
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- revert: Reverts a previous commit

Rules:
- Use present tense ("add" not "added")
- Use lowercase
- No period at the end
- Limit subject line to 72 characters
- Optionally include scope: type(scope): description

Examples:
- feat: add priority field to todos
- fix(backend): resolve database connection issue
- docs: update README with setup instructions
- refactor(service): simplify TodoService logic
- test: add unit tests for TodoController
